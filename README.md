<p align="center">An hazzle-free CUI tool to monitor your kubernetes cluster.</p>

## Why ?

Memorising commands and checking updates constantly is an issue which anyone who works with kubernetes faces. Inspired by tools like lazydocker, we wanted to make monitoring and working with kubernetes an hazzle-free experience.
